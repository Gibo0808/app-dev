**Lucifer MorningStar, formerly known as Samael as well as his nickname, the Light-Bringer, is the titular protagonist of Lucifer. He is an Archangel and the younger identical twin brother of Michael. Following a failed rebellion against his Father, Lucifer was banished from Heaven and forced to oversee the torture of damned Human souls for eons as the Ruler of Hell. During his time as the King of Hell, Lucifer tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden, leading to Eve and her husband Adam being banished to live on Earth for the rest of their lives. After some visits to Earth, He would reunite with his old friend, Lilith in 1946 to help her find her ring. Lucifer was ultimately gifted the ring, along with Lilith's Immortality. Widely known as the Devil or Satan by Humans, Lucifer is blamed for the sins of mankind.**

While she was initially shocked at the discovery, she later realizes that her connection to Lucifer is real, and she confesses her love to him.**
